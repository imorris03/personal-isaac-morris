Hi, thanks for stopping by.  

My name is Isaac Morris. I am a christian. I am a web-design and religion double major at Georgetown College. I am a part of Georgetown's independant honors program; and while here at college, I ran cross country a couple of times. Some fun facts about me: one time I kicked a shark (accidentally) and I also rehabilitated birds of prey at a nature center for a few years. 

My personal goal is to live the life God intends for me, loving Him and loving others. My secondary goal is to secure a job as a web designer. I hope that this 'warmup-website,' which was created for CSC 324 at Georgetown College, can assist me in finding a job in my field of study so that I can achieve these goals.
