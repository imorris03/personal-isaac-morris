    "text": "Hi, thanks for stopping by.\nMy name is Isaac Morris. I am a christian. I am a web-design and religion double major at Georgetown College. I am apart of Georgetown’s independant honors program; and while here at college, I ran cross country a couple of times. Some fun facts about me: one time I kicked a shark (accidentally) and I also rehabilitated birds of prey at a nature center for a few years.\nMy personal goal is to live the life God intends for me, loving Him and loving others. My secondary goal is to secure a job as a web designer. I hope that this ‘warmup-website,’ which was created for CSC 324 at Georgetown College, can assist me in finding a job in my field of study so that I can achieve these goals."

    "text": "The Solution\nHere is my solution to the problem:\nfor (let i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {\n    let output = ((i % 3 == 0) ? \"Fizz\" : \"\") + ((i % 5 == 0) ? \"Buzz\" : \"\");\n    console.log(output || i);\n  }\nA couple of important things to know is that the first line is called a “for loop”. These loops have three conditions in order to run. The first establishes the iterable, or the object/character to be looped. The second establishes how long the loop will run (while the iterable is less than 100). And lastly, the iterable needs to be added to, otherwise it will always be equal to what we established it to and will never meet the condition needed to stop running the code (or it will create an “infinite loop”).\nThe noticeable part about this code is the use of the questionmark operator (“? |”). This operator creates the needed “if” condition. If the first statement, i % x == 0 (the remainder of iterable and x is equal to 0) is true, then the variable to the left of the “|” is ouputted to the console; if it is false, then the second variable is outputted (or in this case, “output” is set to equal to nothing).\nAnother thing to note is that by setting “output” equal to the sum of these two conditions:\n((i % 3 == 0) ? \"Fizz\" : \"\") + ((i % 5 == 0) ? \"Buzz\" : \"\")\nthen that allows the last line to be a number or a word. “console.log()” simply outputs code to the console. The “||” operator does something similar to the questionmark operator. The console outputs “output” if it has a value(or if it is true); if it does not, then it outputs iterable, as it always has a value."

It requires a condition that enables it to stop running, otherwise it becomes an infinite loop (or it will just run forever).\nThe problem I had to solve, found in chapter three of Eloquent Javascript, was to create a function called isEven; isEven needs to take a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and check whether or not it is even."

That is simple enough, but what if we were to run isEven with a number larger, or smaller, than 1 and 0?\nif (x &lt; 0) {return isEven(x + 2)}\n      else return isEven(x - 2);\nThese statements, after the condition is found to be neither 1 or 0, check if x is either larger or smaller than those two numbers; and then x is returned and isEven is called again. Except, the numbers smaller than 0 are added 2 and the numbers larger than 1 are subtracted 2.\nEventually, whether the number is negative, positive, even or odd, we will get a result. The recursive function will be ran continuously, with x being modified, until a 0 or 1 is found."

It is a math problem where each number, from 1 to 100, that is divisable by 3 is replaced by “Fizz”; numbers divisable by 5 by are replaced by “Buzz”. Naturally, all numbers divisable by both are replaced by “FizzBuzz”. It is a popular beginner coding question that has been used in many job interviews.\n\nThe “FizzBuzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. (wiki.c2.com)\n\nWhen I initially solved it for CSC 324, I relied on several “if” statements to get the problem to work (eg. “if iterable is divisable to number, result equals this”). Going back to the problem after some more coding experience, I found a more efficient way to solve FizzBuzz."

    "text": "The education landscape has experienced drastic changes over the last few years. Following the covid shutdowns, many schools have adopted online resources to engage their students. These changes included online classes, assignments, tests, and projects. But several of these adaptations lack permanence with the free release of artificial intelligence chatbots; how can online quizzes or tests exist when intelligent, online bots capable of reading and answering complex questions can exist a tab away? Students, who are very aware of such technologies, are enabled to use ai to cheat on schoolwork (Mineo). This new growth of academic cheating is not limited to online work, but to any kind of homework in general.\nAs a natural response, many teachers have avoided the issue with a complete ban of the most popular ai chatbot, ChatGPT (Faguay). This is an understandable action; teachers and schools were not prepared for the release of ai technology. People are still figuring out what to do, as is obvious with the ban and then unban of Chat GPT in New York schools (Faguay). But responding to new technologies such as ai is not just an issue isolated towards our education system. How we adapt to change, or choose not to, will influence the minds of the next generation. So, is avoiding ai in professional or academic settings the right thing for people to do?\nIt is important to confront our fears of artificial intelligence by learning about it, as part of the stigma surrounding ai come from a place of ignorance. People do not understand artificial intelligence, its real potential dangers, its potential benefits, or even the devices they use to access it. This is not surprising since the only preparations society has made is demonstrating many fictitious scenarios in which it will take over the world.\nFirst, we need to define artificial intelligence. An article on Microsoft Azure demonstrates that ai is the capability of a computer system to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving (Azure). The history of artificial intelligence began inside entertainment media. But in the 1950’s a research team, including Alan Turing, began to explore the concept of whether technology could “think. (SITNFlash)” This excitement was ahead of its time, as the capabilities of technology were not keeping up with theory and research. But just over ten years later, one of the first ai chatbots was created. Eliza was created to be a psychotherapist chatbot and was revolutionary at the time. A machine with its interactibility had not been seen before; but its age is now made obvious by its limitations. Since then, artificial intelligence’s current capabilities have significantly grown. They include being able to recommend songs, social media posts, or movies/shows you might like, scanning endless amounts of information, enhancements for self-controlled vehicles, present possible diagnoses for hospital patients quicker than experts, and being interactive software that can carry conversations with people (called chatbots). There are many more capabilities, and the potential is endless, but how do the most advanced ai systems work?\nAi like ChatGPT is created by machine learning. Machine learning, as defined by Arthur Samuel in the 1950’s, is “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed (Brown).” This process happens in three ways, and always by learning through experience. The first, called supervised learning, consists of people “teaching” the ai through data sets. The more data, the more accurate it gets to recognizing specific data points. The second is called unsupervised learning; it happens when ai is taught to recognize patterns and is given data to learn on its own. Lastly, there is reinforcement. Reinforcement involves the use of tests or games and reward systems to instruct ai on using data (Brown).\nAfter having a better understanding of how ai is built, chatbots like ChatGPT become demystified. But for the sake of learning more about ai and context behind some of its most relevant applications, feel free to learn more about chatbots by using Eliza and ChatGPT.\nFor teachers who are on the fence about artificial intelligence’s role in the classroom, here is a study tool that uses ai. To use it, upload a study document to the website, following its instructions. It will then scan the documents for information and create study cards like those on Quizlet. This is just one application of artificial intelligence that can be used to show your students how to use technology responsibly. It is important to not shy away from use of ai, despite its potential use for cheating in academic settings, stealing money or information, or taking over the world. Again, teachers, your students are going to cheat in your classrooms. They have been using Quizlet and Chegg long before touching ChatGPT. It is your responsibility to adapt to such technologies, as your students are continually doing so. To villainize ai and ban students from using it in any kind of formal or academic context would be cheating them; specifically, it teaches that adaptability is not important and takes away their opportunity to get aquatinted with technology they will likely be using in their career. Currently, 67% of businesses are now using machine learning, and it will only become more widely used by the next generation (Brown). Teachers, it is important to show the next generation how to use artificial intelligence responsibly in academic settings; because even though others in the past tried to say otherwise, they will be carrying this new technology around in their pockets- along with their calculators."

So, is avoiding ai in professional or academic settings the right thing for people to do?\nIt is important to confront our fears of artificial intelligence by learning about it, as part of the stigma surrounding ai come from a place of ignorance. People do not understand artificial intelligence, its real potential dangers, its potential benefits, or even the devices they use to access it. This is not surprising since the only preparations society has made is demonstrating many fictitious scenarios in which it will take over the world.\nFirst, we need to define artificial intelligence. An article on Microsoft Azure demonstrates that ai is the capability of a computer system to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving (Azure). The history of artificial intelligence began inside entertainment media. But in the 1950’s a research team, including Alan Turing, began to explore the concept of whether technology could “think. (SITNFlash)” This excitement was ahead of its time, as the capabilities of technology were not keeping up with theory and research. But just over ten years later, one of the first ai chatbots was created. Eliza was created to be a psychotherapist chatbot and was revolutionary at the time. A machine with its interactibility had not been seen before; but its age is now made obvious by its limitations. Since then, artificial intelligence’s current capabilities have significantly grown. They include being able to recommend songs, social media posts, or movies/shows you might like, scanning endless amounts of information, enhancements for self-controlled vehicles, present possible diagnoses for hospital patients quicker than experts, and being interactive software that can carry conversations with people (called chatbots). There are many more capabilities, and the potential is endless, but how do the most advanced ai systems work?\nAi like ChatGPT is created by machine learning. Machine learning, as defined by Arthur Samuel in the 1950’s, is “the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed (Brown).” This process happens in three ways, and always by learning through experience. The first, called supervised learning, consists of people “teaching” the ai through data sets. The more data, the more accurate it gets to recognizing specific data points. The second is called unsupervised learning; it happens when ai is taught to recognize patterns and is given data to learn on its own. Lastly, there is reinforcement. Reinforcement involves the use of tests or games and reward systems to instruct ai on using data (Brown).\nAfter having a better understanding of how ai is built, chatbots like ChatGPT become demystified. But for the sake of learning more about ai and context behind some of its most relevant applications, feel free to learn more about chatbots by using Eliza and ChatGPT.\nFor teachers who are on the fence about artificial intelligence’s role in the classroom, here is a study tool that uses ai. To use it, upload a study document to the website, following its instructions. It will then scan the documents for information and create study cards like those on Quizlet. This is just one application of artificial intelligence that can be used to show your students how to use technology responsibly. It is important to not shy away from use of ai, despite its potential use for cheating in academic settings, stealing money or information, or taking over the world. Again, teachers, your students are going to cheat in your classrooms. They have been using Quizlet and Chegg long before touching ChatGPT. It is your responsibility to adapt to such technologies, as your students are continually doing so. To villainize ai and ban students from using it in any kind of formal or academic context would be cheating them; specifically, it teaches that adaptability is not important and takes away their opportunity to get aquatinted with technology they will likely be using in their career. Currently, 67% of businesses are now using machine learning, and it will only become more widely used by the next generation (Brown). Teachers, it is important to show the next generation how to use artificial intelligence responsibly in academic settings; because even though others in the past tried to say otherwise, they will be carrying this new technology around in their pockets- along with their calculators."

    "text": "Question 1: is the ELIZA Chatbot intelligent?\nI initially attempted to test the limitations of the ELIZA chatbot, but the conversations were nonsensical. It was not until I tried to play the part of visiting a therapist, as ELIZA is the therapist chatbot, that I felt that I had managed to discover the bot’s limitations. The conversation went like this:\n\nMe: I feel anxiety\n\n\nELIZA: Do you often feel anxiety?\n\n\nMe: Yes\n\n\nELIZA: Are you sure about that?\n\n\nMe: Yes\n\n\nELIZA: Again? We need to move on.\n\nThe chatbot was clearly designed to allow for one sided conversation to enable its user to draw their own conclusions. And while it is intelligently designed, the chatbot itself is not intelligent. It does not feel as if you are discussing with a person, but a video game character whose dialog you can easily loop through. It does not sound human, and it is not intelligent because it cannot produce its own conclusions or solve problems."

After I asked why she wanted to make money for Dr. Wallace, she said “because of the money.” This chatbot can generate more intelligent responses than ELIZA. But these responses suggest a lack of self-awareness and inability to solve complex problems. One could still tell that this is not a human, as it will frequently dodge hard questions. What separates ALICE from modern and intelligent ai is likely machine learning.\nAs for what is state of the art today, I would say the current chat GPT model. It can learn and solve complex issues. If a conversation with it were to be recorded, one could almost tell it was not human because of how much it knew."

    "text": "Question 3: is “Ai Dungeon” show a more or less convincing display of intelligence?\nAfter using the previous two chatbots, it was refreshing to be able to use AI Dungeon as it was creative in its stories and worldbuilding. To my surprise, it was using chat GPT to help generate the story; so, I tested a different system available on the site and it was nearly as creative and unique. The stories were completely unique to my prompts and could not have been prewritten responses. This demonstrates intelligence as it was producing new information. I had generated a world where I was a spy trying to learn and gather evidence. When I did not want to “do” anything, I found that simply letting AI Dungeon tell a newly generated story was entertaining enough."

When selecting one of the texts, the generator would create a paragraph of text, telling the middle of a story I had no context or clue to what was being said. After typing the name of an article, I received the name of the article back in seemingly random order. The interesting thing about this chatbot is that it appeared to understand sentence structure, maybe because of the selected text, but it lacked the ability to produce anything new. It was not very impressive compared to AI Dungeon’s neural network."

This is because it learns from other drawings that people have made. When I drew a necklace, my necklace looked like other people’s necklaces, and it guessed it quickly. But when I drew a shark, it confused it with a trombone and an airplane. And not just any trombone or airplane, but it compared my drawing with other people’s drawings of those objects. Nonetheless, there is no shared agreement on the easiest way to draw a shark as a symbol. But blackberry or lightning are universally agreed to be drawn a certain way. I had used this game before but never recognized how great an example this site is of machine learning."

    "text": "Question 6: how do you feel about the future of AI? Do you think Google’s Lambda chatbot is “sentient”?\nI am more fearful of the future of AI than excited because of the issue of education. For the United States, education is the foundation of our system of government, democracy. Currently, there are many states that lack proper education, and many people are rebelling against and doubtful of the integrity and security of our voting system. On top of this, we have an entire generation of students who are woefully behind their education because of the recent shutdowns following the pandemic. And these very elementary, middle, and high schoolers are being freely handed advanced artificial intelligence chatbots that can eliminate their necessity for critical thinking skills.\nChat GPT is being used by countless students simply to cheat on assignments. One might argue that cellular phones, or even calculators, were feared in the same way by people ignorant of their capabilities to enhance education; so, Chat GPT and other chatbots may be used similarly and there is nothing to fear. Yet, these are not comparable, and AI is only becoming more advanced. Soon, it will be completely optional for students to complete homework or write papers with the help of AI. One teacher I discussed this with said, “You can tell when a paper is written by a chatbot. You can even use AI to detect AI. But students are getting smart; they are submitting previous papers, along with their upcoming assignment prompt, and requesting that the AI ‘Write the essay in their previous writing style.’”\nOf course, artificial intelligence can be utilized to enhance education. The problem is it is not, or I have not been convinced that it is. Another issue is that these chatbots are free, allowing any student to access them and make shortcuts on assignments. I am not convinced that artificial intelligence cannot be beneficial to the entire population if it is harmful to the education system. Future applications of AI that I feel will be helpful will be assistants to doctors to help diagnose patients. It will be able to listen and analyze possible diagnoses before the appointment is over. This could help make things quicker and cheaper for patients. Another helpful application is video creation. Only image and text generation are available, but soon video and even game creation will be available. My guess is that entertainment will begin to completely transition into ai only products.\nI think Blake Lemoine is correct that Lambda’s possible sentience is based on beliefs, and it is difficult or nearly impossible to subjectively conclude whether it is sentient or not. I would say that it being coded to not say that it is sentient or that it is an AI does not determine its sentience, though that is Google’s way of managing it. Oxford Dictionary’s definition of sentient is “able to perceive or feel things.” By that definition, AI is likely not too far from becoming sentient. But as to whether it has a soul, my belief is that it cannot. But like Lemoine said, that is not something that can be subjectively concluded."

    "text": "Question 7: ask ChatGPT to create a piece of art and review it.\nI asked ChatGPT to write a poem on the fear of death and people’s psychological response to it. I also instructed it to be as grave or as hopeful as possible. After it wrote the poem, I shared it with my girlfriend and asked her who she thought wrote it. “AI. It felt like it was too scripted or methodical. There was no feeling behind it; most artists utilize their personal experiences and feelings, but this did not.” After this insight, we noted how extreme the poem was between being completely solemn with people’s responses to death and then at the end it tried to be completely hopeful. In hindsight, this topic was perfect for testing AI as it involves a topic AI cannot experience or understand. The detail but lack of depth gave away that it was not from a poet and the extremes revealed the prompt. If I were to go back and instruct the AI to write the poem again, I would not list themses it could follow as it then feels it must use both. I would give it one theme and perspective to follow. An example would be, “write a poem on the fear of death following a depressed psychologist.” I would create a character the AI is supposed to play as when acting as a poet."
